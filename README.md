An identification and ranking system for characterizing blind spots in large trucks.

This project aims to create a tool which provides blindspot ratings on different models for several different stakeholders:
- Insurance companies: to create premium pricing which correlates to the likelihood of accidents.
- Fleet managers: to make more informed purchasing decisions around which vehicles are the safest on the road.
- Cities and policymakers: to provide cities with a resource on the relative dangers of different truck models and support rightsizing initiatives.
